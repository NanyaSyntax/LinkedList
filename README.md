In this README, I present a project that focuses on linked lists. The project is aimed at understanding and practising data organization, structuring, and access. I have successfully recreated generic classes for the following data structures:

Singly Linked List
Stack
Queue
This project allowed me to gain valuable insights into data organization principles and implement these fundamental data structures in a generic manner.
